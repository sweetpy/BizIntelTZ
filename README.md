Key endpoints include:
- `POST /business` to create businesses
- `POST /scrape` to generate sample data
- `GET /export` to download a CSV of all businesses
- `GET /reviews/{biz_id}` to list reviews
- `POST /claims/approve/{index}` for claim moderation

## Usage
Install dependencies and run the application:

For production deployments, run Uvicorn without `--reload` and use a process
manager such as `systemd`, `supervisor`, or `docker` to keep the server running
continuously:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```
